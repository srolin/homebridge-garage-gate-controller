# garage-gate-opener-homebridge
Raspberry Pi GPIO Garage and/or Gate Opener plugin for [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)

This plugin is suitable for any device as a garage door or a gate motor that needs a brief contact (switch) to trigger an action as a opening or a closing.

This was based on the original developed by Mforge - details can be found at: [MForge.org](http://www.mforge.org)

I modified this and rewrote elements due to its handling of external triggering not displaying the correct status.
